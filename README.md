# RoughFruitSkin
This code is intended for Blender users who are looking to add citrus fruit material. In order for this code to work, you will need to be in Cycles Render and use Nodes for your material.
## Setting Up Your Object
For this example, I used a sphere. First you will need to unwrap your object. Of course, mark the seams that you deem appropriate before unwrapping.
